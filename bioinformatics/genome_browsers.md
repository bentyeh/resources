# IGV

Notes applicable to version 2.19.4.

## Directory Setup

igv-launcher_portable.bat: adapted from igv-launcher.bat with the following key changes
  1. Ignores `%USERPROFILE%/.igv/java_arguments`
  2. Uses/stores preferences, log file, and genomes in `data/` directory

data/ (defaults to `~/igv/` on Unix/Linux systems):
- genomes
  - Stores genome specification files. See [JSON Genome Format](https://igv.org/doc/igvjs/#Reference-Genome/).
    - Note that binary \*.genome files (now considered deprecated) are just zip archives [(IGV documentation)](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/configuring_genome_server). They are not necessarily complete genomes for local (offline) access and can still request online data.
      - The \*.genome files available via the IGV/Broad Institute Amazon S3 buckets do *not* appear to contain the actual genome sequences; they appear to only contain some gene annotations.
  - The hg38/mm10/chm13v2.0.json files are from the `igv.org.genomes` Amazon S3 bucket (`<genome>/<genome>.json`).
    - The RefSeq tracks are [genePred](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format9) format files generated by UCSC. These are not indexed, so they are completely loaded into memory. That is okay, since the files are only tens of MB uncompressed.
  - The default genome.json files seem to follow UCSC chromosome naming conventions and a curated RefSeq genome annotation. Below, I show how to display GENCODE annotations by default (see the "GENCODE Comprehensive" track) and allow searching by Ensembl IDs, MGI IDs (and other GTF tags).
    - First, create a sorted and indexed GTF file. (Sorting is required for `tabix` to generate an index. The sorted GTF file is no longer hierarchically structured, but IGV will still understand transcript intron/exon structures.) This file will not be fully loaded into memory and therefore will not be searchable. However, clicking on a feature in the track will still show all GTF attributes associated with the feature.
      ```
      wget -q -O - 'https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_mouse/release_M25/gencode.vM25.primary_assembly.annotation.gtf.gz' |
      gunzip -c |
      awk -F'\t' '!/^#/' |
      sort -k 1,1V -k 4,4n -k 5,5n |
      bgzip > gencode.vM25.primary_assembly.sorted.gtf.gz
      tabix gencode.vM25.primary_assembly.sorted.gtf.gz
      ```
    - Additionally create a `transcript` feature type-only GTFs to be used as a hidden track. This file will be loaded into memory, thereby enabling searching Ensembl gene IDs, Ensembl transcript IDs, Ensembl protein IDs, MGI IDs, and ccdsids in the IGV search bar. To conserve memory, I discard several attributes (e.g., `havana_gene`) that are not commonly used.
      ```
      gunzip -c 'gencode.vM25.primary_assembly.annotation.sorted.gtf.gz' |
      awk -F'\t' '$3 == "transcript"' |
      sed -E -e 's/gene_type "[^"]+";\s*//' \
            -e 's/transcript_type "[^"]+";\s*//' \
            -e 's/; level [0-9]+;/;/' \
            -e 's/; transcript_support_level "([0-9]+|NA)";/;/' \
            -e 's/tag "[^"]+";\s*//g' \
            -e 's/havana_gene "[^"]+";\s*//' \
            -e 's/havana_transcript "[^"]+";\s*//' |
      bgzip > 'gencode.vM25.primary_assembly.transcripts.gtf.gz'
      ```
    - Finally, I reference these files in my custom genome.json file. Note that the chromAlias file (`"aliasURL"` key) is necessary for IGV to automatically convert between UCSC chromosome names used in the FASTA file, cytoband file, and RefSeq track, and the GenBank IDs used by GENCODE annotation GTFs for non-primary chromosome scaffolds. I use the same `id` ("mm10") as in the default mm10.json file so that IGV recognizes that this is the mm10 genome and provides convenient menus to load publicly available annotations (File > Load from Server ...) and ENCODE tracks (e.g., File > ENCODE ChIP Signals ...).

## IGV Notes

Default behaviors of IGV version 2.13.2
- If no genome is available in its data directory (see `--igvDirectory` argument; defaults to `"%USERPROFILE%/igv/"`), it will try to load hg19 from https://s3.amazonaws.com/igv.org.genomes/hg19/hg19.json.
  - This behavior is evident from the log file in the data directory. (Clear the data/genomes directory, then launch IGV, and open the log file.)
- IGV will always create `%USERPROFILE%/.igv/java_arguments` if it does not already exist. This is not affected by the `--igvDirectory` argument.
- The default Genome server URL is https://s3.amazonaws.com/igv.org.genomes/genomes.tsv. See View > Preferences > Advanced.
- The default Data registry server is https://data.broadinstitute.org/igvdata/$$_dataServerRegistry.txt. See View > Preferences > Advanced. This specifies what available datasets are shown when you click File > Load from Server...
  - Example: https://data.broadinstitute.org/igvdata/hg38_dataServerRegistry.txt contains a link to an XML file (https://s3.amazonaws.com/igv.org.genomes/hg38/hg38_annotations.xml) that contains an organized set of annotations files for the hg38 genome, largely from the `igv.org.genomes` Amazon S3 bucket.
  - <span style="color: red">Most of these files *appear* to correspond to UCSC files, but their provenance is not explicitly clear.</span>
    - Example of minor discrepancy: RepeatMasker annotations for mouse mm10 genome
      - UCSC: either from [bigZips directory](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/bigZips/latest/mm10.chromOut.tar.gz) or download via [UCSC Table Browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables) (group = "Variation and Repeats", track = "RepeatMasker", region = genome, filter = genoName does match "chr1") --> 72067 LINE loci on chromosome 1
      - IGV: from [Amazon S3 bucket](https://s3.amazonaws.com/igv.org.genomes/mm10/rmsk/mm10_rmsk_LINE.bed.gz) --> 72070 LINE loci on chromosome 1. The 3 extra LINE loci are all marked with a ? (as in "LINE?").

IGV/Broad Institute Amazon S3 buckets. A GET request directed at the bucket URL yields an XML file that gives a partial list of files available under that Amazon S3 bucket.
- https://s3.amazonaws.com/igv.broadinstitute.org/
  - The files listed in the XML file appear to all be annotation files
    (e.g., such as cytoband files or GENCODE GTF files).
  - Some genome specification files (\*.genome) appear to be stored in this Amazon S3 bucket, but are not listed in the XML file. See the default IGV Genome database (https://s3.amazonaws.com/igv.org.genomes/genomes.tsv) for examples.
- https://s3.amazonaws.com/igv.org.genomes/
  - The files listed in the XML file appear to be a mix of genome specification files (\*.genome or \*.json) and annotation files.
  - This appears to be more up-to-date:
    - Many genomes are provided as \*.json specifications. See https://github.com/igvteam/igv/wiki/Downloading-Hosted-Genomes-for-Offline-Use
    - The T2T CHM13 genome (chm13v2.0) is availabe here.
    - See also the Data registry server discussed above.

How tracks are loaded
- Indexing annotation files (e.g., via `tabix` from htslib) allow quick, memory-efficient loading, but indexed annotation files are not searchable [(see GitHub Issue)](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/244).
- Non-indexed annotation files are loaded completely into memory.
