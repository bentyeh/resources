Genome-specific data: `https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/<genome>/`
- Example: Human GRCh38 = https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/
- Structure
  - chromosomes/: a FASTA file for each chromosome
  - database/: annotations
    - RepeatMasker tracks
      - rmsk.txt.gz: source unclear (not described in the GitHub repo)
      - rmskAlign* and rmskOut*: very similar, except that Align corresponds to the ".align" file generated by RepeatMasker that shows the alignments between the repeat and query sequence, which is missing from the ".out" file. rmskOut* appears to be the main annotation file to use.
      - rmsk\*Baseline vs. rmsk\*Current: based on the GitHub repo, appear to correspond to older vs. newer annotations
      - rmskJoined*: a "RepeatMasker Visualization track" (unclear)
    - ... many others ...
  - bigZips/: genome, selected annotation files and updates
    - RepeatMasker-masked genome FASTA files
    - hg38.chrom.sizes
    - (Updated regularly) RefSeq mRNA multi-FASTA files
    - (Updated regularly) upstream1000/2000/5000: sequences 1000/2000/5000 bases upstream of annotated TSSs of RefSeq genes with annotated 5' UTRs.
