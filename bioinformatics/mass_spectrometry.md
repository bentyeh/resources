MSI visualization
- [Biomap](https://ms-imaging.org/wp/biomap/)
  - IDL package

## File formats

| Format              | Extension(s)   | Data type          | Notes
| ------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ----------
| Analyze 7.5         | `.img`, `.hdr` | MSI voxels         | [Specification](https://rportal.mayo.edu/bir/ANALYZE75.pdf), [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/working-with-mayo-analyze-7-5-files.html)
| ABI/Sciex 4700/4800 | `.t2d`         | mass spectrum      | The only converter I found that does not require the original libraries that come with the ABI/Sciex Data Explorer software is [t2d2mzxml](http://www.pepchem.org/download/converter.html). [MSight](https://web.expasy.org/MSight/) appears to be able to open  `.t2d` files, but it cannot convert them to mzML or mzXML files.

    - Reverse Fit (RFit): "degree of inclusion of the target spectrum in a database spectrum" (think: # shared peaks / # peaks in the target spectrum)
    - Purity: combined measure (think: # shared peaks / # of unique peaks across database and target spectra)

## Software notes

### Cardinal

Methods for downsampling data
- `peakBin`
- `reduceDimension`
  - Explored in the legacy Cardinal guide rather than the Cardinal 2 User Guide.
  - `method="bin"`: mean of `width` m/z values
  - `method="resample"`: linear interpolation
  - Source code: https://github.com/kuwisdelu/Cardinal/blob/master/R/process-reduceDimension.R
- `peakAlign`
