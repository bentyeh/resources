## Genes

Nucleotide strand sense
- [Context: chromosomal DNA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21303550)
  - Sense: strand with 5'-end on the short arm (i.e. the 5'-end is closest to the centromere); this is the strand usually referred to in databases and genome browsers
  - Antisense: strand with 3'-end on the short arm
- [Context: intracellular mRNA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/probe/docs/glossary/#antisense_rna)
  - Sense: the target intracellular mRNA
  - Antisense: complementary to target intracellular mRNA, produced naturally or introduced artificially
  - More references: 
- [Context: transcription](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68016373)
  - Sense / coding: same sequence as the mRNA transcript
  - Antisense / template: template for mRNA synthesis
  - Also applies to context of single-stranded RNA viral genomes
